# Red Teaming Portfolio

This repository documents structured red teaming work focused on large language model (LLM) reliability, safety testing, and evaluation design.

The emphasis is on:
- Adversarial prompt testing (sanitized)
- Rubric-based evaluation and calibration
- Consistency and regression analysis
- Practical mitigation strategies

All artifacts are intentionally sanitized to prevent misuse while preserving technical insight and methodological rigor.


* **Writeups**: clear problem framing, approach, and outcomes
* **Artifacts**: sanitized prompts, notes, and reports
* **Evals**: rubric-based reasoning and consistency checks
